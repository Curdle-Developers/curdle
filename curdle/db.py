# The main structure of the below code is taken from the official Flask documentation 
# This explains how to connect to a SQLite database using Flask/Python's native support

# A connection to the database will be created when handling a request
# In the case that the database needs to be accessed more than once during a request, 
# the object 'g' stores the connection for reuse if get_db() is called again

# The connection to the db should be closed before responding to a request

     with current_app.open_resource('schema.sql') as f:

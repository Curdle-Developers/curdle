# The __init__ file tells Flask that a folder should be treated as a package
# When the app package is imported by 'setup.py' this file is run automatically because of its file name
# From the python package flask, import the class Flask

from app import dbinit, routes, models

# Import our python module 'routes' which contains instructions what to render on what URL for the web site/application
# The name of the folder this file is in is 'app'. This means app is a python package, and we can import individual modules from it as needed
# Models is a python module containing object models relating to each table in the SQLite database - required for SQLAlchemy flask extension
